        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to create a Machine Learning model that can correctly classify the MVP of NBA seasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data\n",
        "\n",
        "The data for this project utilizes every player from the NBA from 1982-2017 and their advanced statistics (TS%, WS, PER, and more) that is transformed into a vector to be used in a Logistic Regression Model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data sets used were found on Kaggle and consisted in:\n",
        "- MVP Names\n",
        "- All Player Statistics \n",
        "- All Team Records \n",
        "The Team Record for a given year was appended to all the Player Vectors used in the Data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gather and Prepare Data**: This step involves creating data structures for our model to use for classifying an MVP for a season. The data is turned into feature vectors and has the team record for that season appended.\n",
        "2. **Retrieve Testing and Training Data**: Testing and training data is based on the 1982-2017 NBA seasons. Each data point for training is the stats of a player for a particular season. The classes are positive or negative, where positive indicates the player is the MVP of the specific season the stats are in.\n",
        "3. **Training**: We are utilizing logistic regression to train our binary classifier. Due to how logistic regression optimizes on a sigmoid curve, we can obtain probabilities as to how close predictions of stats are to MVP status.\n",
        "4. **Testing**: We use the probabilities from our logistic regression classifier to rank the stats of players in a season it has not seen before. The average distance in rankings from the predicted MVP to the actual MVP is our primary performance metric to demonstrate the margin of error.\n",
        "We test on held-out seasons, which consist of a list of player stats for a given season. The classifier predicts the MVP probability for each player stat in the season and then we rank these probabilities.\n",
        "To increase the accuracy rating, bagging has been utilized in our logistic regression classifier using 10 bags.\n"

The accuracy of our model varies from 60% to 75% for getting the prediction correct (i.e., our #1 ranking prediction is the actual MVP), but we are noticing an average of 1 to 3 positions away in ranking from the correct classification when our prediction is wrong. Therefore, we believe that some of the errors caused with our model is due to these external factors, and given that our model is only 1 to 3 players away from the correct classification on average out of ~300-500 players in a season, it appears promising.\n",
